# Bagels

Bagels is a detective logic game where the player attempts to guess a secret number generated by the computer. The number has no repeated digits and the player has a limited number of guesses to get it right. The game provides clues after each guess to help the player narrow down the possibilities.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. The computer generates a secret number.
3. You have a limited number of guesses to figure out the secret number.
4. After each guess, the game provides clues:
   - "Fermi" indicates a correct digit in the correct position.
   - "Pico" indicates a correct digit in the wrong position.
   - "Bagels" means no digit is correct.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the secret number or run out of guesses.

## Features

- Customizable number of digits in the secret number.
